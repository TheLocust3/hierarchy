# hierarchy

A Trello-like task manager, but with trees and graphs to help me plan my life better.  
This project is currently in active development.

## to-do

- Create Trello-like view backed with task graph
- Create single overlay (instead of a bunch of individual ones)
- Handle server errors properly
- Some weird bugs when adding/updating cards quickly
- Delete relationship
