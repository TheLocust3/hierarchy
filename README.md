# hierarchy

A Trello-like task manager, but with trees and graphs to help me plan my life better.  
This project is currently in active development.

## to-do

- Are you sure you want to delete the root node?
- Create single overlay (instead of a bunch of individual ones)
- Handle server errors properly
- Some weird bugs when adding/updating cards quickly
- Trees of some large height just stop rendering properly
- General refactor
  - Ability to add rules to graphs (has one of type, has many of type)
    - Change state of card when added to tree
