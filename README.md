# hierarchy

A Trello-like task manager, but with trees and graphs to help me plan my life better.  
This project is currently in active development.

## to-do

- Using back and forward buttons sometimes don't work
- Create single overlay (instead of a bunch of individual ones)
- Handle server errors properly
- Some weird bugs when adding/updating cards quickly
- Trees of some large height just stop rendering properly
- UI revamp
- Refactor EditableNode (it's becoming a monolith)
- General refactor
  - Ability to add rules to graphs (has one of type, has many of type)
    - Change state of card when added to tree
  - Define new types that can be added to cards (show up under labels and status)
